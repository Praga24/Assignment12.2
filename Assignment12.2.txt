1. Difference between HBASE and HDFS. 
HDFS(Hadoop Distributed File System) is a distributed file system abstracted on top of the local file system
by the hadoop which does not provide tabular form of storage while the HBASE is a distributed column oriented database
running on top of HDFS that provide tabular form of storage of realtime semi and unstructed bigdata.

2. List and explain components of HBASE. 
The components of HBASE are:
Region servers serve data for reads and writes.
Regions are assigned to the Regoin Servers.A region server can serve about 1,000 regions.
HBase Master process handles the Region assignment, DDL (create, delete tables) operations.
Zookeeper maintains a live cluster state.
The Hadoop DataNode stores the data that the Region Server is managing.
The NameNode maintains metadata information for all the physical data blocks.

3. When should we use HBASE, list some of the scenarios for the same. 
HBASE should be used when the data has:
A variable schema
When data is stored in the form of collections
If the application demands key based access to data while retrieving.

4. What are the different modes in which Hbase can be run? 
HBASE can run in two different modes
Standalone mode 
Distributed mode
By default HBASE is in standalone mode to run in distributed mode we need to edit the configuration in conf directory.

5. Why is zookeeper needed in Hbase? 
HBase uses ZooKeeper as a distributed coordination service to maintain server state in the cluster.
Zookeeper maintains which servers are alive and available, and provides server failure notification. 

6. Hbase is a schema less database, what does it mean? 
Hbase doesnot have fixed column specification we define only column families as a key value pair , therfore 
Hbase is a schemaless database.

7. What is the minimum number of column family every Hbase table should have? 
Every Hbase table must have atleast 1 column family.

8. What is the benefit of using connection pool in Hbase?
With connection pooling we can pre-create a connection for applications which require high-end multithreaded access.

9. What is the difference between memstore and hfile in HBase?
MemStore: It is the write cache. It stores new data which has not yet been written to disk. It is sorted before
writing to disk.

HFiles: Stores the rows as sorted KeyValues on disk.

10.Describe compactions in HBase
There are 2 type of compaction in HBase
Minor Compaction:
HBase will automatically pick some smaller HFiles and rewrite them into fewer bigger Hfiles.
Minor compaction reduces the number of storage files by rewriting smaller files into
fewer but larger ones, performing a merge sort.

Major Compaction:
Major compaction merges and rewrites all the HFiles in a region to one HFile per column family, and in 
the process, drops deleted or expired cells.
This improves read performance; however, since major compaction rewrites all of the files, lot of disk I/O 
and network traffic might occur during the process.

11.List and explain the logical entities in HBase.
*Table
HBase organizes data into Tables.
*Row
Within a table, data is stored according to its row.
*RowKey
Rows are identified uniquely by their row key
*Column Family
Data within a row is grouped by column family
*Column Name
Data within a column family is addressed via its column name.
*Cell
A combination of row key, column family, and column qualifier uniquely identifies a cell
*TimeStamp
Values within a cell are versioned.

12.What will happen if we do not create a row key while inserting the data?
It is not possible to insert without rowkey.


13.How can filters be applied in HBase and what are the benefits?
*KeyOnlyFilter
Returns the key component of each key-value.
*FirstKeyOnlyFilter
Returns the first key-value from each row.
*Prefixfilter
Returns those key-values present in a row that starts with the specified row prefix
*ColumnPrefixFilter
Returns those key-values present in a column that starts with the specified column prefix.
*ColumnCountGetFilter
Returns the first limit number of columns in the table.
*PageFilter
Returns page size number of rows from the table.
*InclusiveStopFilter
Returns all key-values present in rows up to and including the specified row.
*Family Filter
Compares each qualifier name with the comparator using the compare operator and if the comparison returns true, it returns all the key-values in that column.
*ValueFilter
Compares each value with the comparator using the compare operator and if the comparison returns true, it returns that key-value.

14.What are the data model operations in hBase?
The data model operations in HBase are:
Get
Put
Scan
Delete

15.How MapReduce can be used with HBase?
We can run mapreduce jobs that uses HBase by adding the HBase and Zookeeper JAR files to the Hadoop Java classpath.

16.What is regionserver? 
Region servers serve data for reads and writes.
Regions are assigned to the Regoin Servers.A region server can serve about 1,000 regions.
